1) Before running step 8, I expect the output to be alternating
but random print out of A's, B's, and C's.

2) When I ran Step 8, the output is alternating print out of A's,
B's and C's, and they all print out the same number of letters 
each iteration. In the the, when sleep(4) ends, the main process
take over.

3) Step 8 output has a mix of A, B, C, but the step 9 output prints
all the A's first, and then alternating printing B's and C's.
This is because printing A now has higher priority, even higher 
than the main process. Thus, it will always be at the front of 
the ready list, which means it will be run until it finishs.

4) Similar to Step 9 where it prints all the A's first, Step 10
prints all the C's first.

5) The output using "printf" is different from the output from 
"kprintf". The output from "printf" doesn't not follow the alternating
pattern discussed above. It prints out letter in a batch, but 
sometimes it adds in another letter.
