1) There will be 30000 attempts to increment global variable total.
2) t1 should be 10000 because it is the first function that increment
the total count and it only increments the count by 10000.
3) The process excuting incr1 finish first because it has the lowest
total count of 10000.
4) The value of variable total is what I expected because counting
10000 is so short for the CPU to perform context switch.
5) The value is not expected 900000, instead, it only counts to 600000.
6) When NITER is equal to 120000, t1 is 120000, t2 is 240000, t3 is 
360000, and total is 360000.
7) When NITER is equal to 150000, t1 is 150000, t2 is 300000, t3 is 
300000, and total is 300000.
8) When NITER is equal to 185000, t1 is 185000, t2 is 370000, t3 is 
370000, and total is 370000.
9) 
10) I added mutual exclusion by inserting wait(semid) before the
++ and inserting signal(semid) after the ++. And, Yes,
it results in correct values for total in all cases.
