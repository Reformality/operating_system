(1) Step 3 worked for transferring zero bytes and CS354
(2) Step 4 worked when transferring BB_SIZE bytes, in this case, it transferred 20 bytes in order. 
(3) Step 5 successfully transferred 300 bytes and 3*BB_SIZE+25 bytes.
(4) Step 6 successfully transferred all bytes with an initial delay in the producer process.
(5) Step 6 successfully transferred all bytes with an initial delay in the consumer process.
(6) Step 7 reports correct counts for both As and Bs.
(7) I added a send() to producer2 and receive() to producer 1. P2 will send a message to P1 when P2 finish
inserting all of Bs. After receive() in P1, I then called bb_endinsert().
(8) Step 8 report the correct number for each characters.
(9) I added a send() to consumer2 and receive() to consumer1. C2 will send a message to C1 when C2 finish. 
After receive() in P1, I then called bb_endextract().
