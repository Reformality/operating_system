(1) I kept the pipe status in the pipetab, so pipe_open knows
when a pipe can be opened by checking whether the pstate is PIPE_FREE
(2) The field of pipe_open does not contain the device descriptor. It was generated
after testing for free pipe.
(3) The return value is the device id of the opened pipe.
(4) Npip represents the number of available pipes will be initialized at startup.
It is defined in conf.h as value of 10. It is inserted into the file in pipe_init.c.
(5) it only waits on the semaphores if the state is OPEN.
(6) it must check the semaphore in case the state changed while being blocked.
(7) 
(8) First, add PIPE10 and PIPE 11 to the configuration file. Then, change the Npip
to 12. 
(9) First, add the function to prototypes.h. Then, change the configuration file
by switching pipe_close to pipe_opt_close.
