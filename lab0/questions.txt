1. The values for character a is valid.

2. I expect the hex output to be 0xfe, but the printf outputs fffffffe.

3. The hex obtained for c3 is fffffffe because the 0xfe in decimal is -2. Since the
OS is 32 bit, the 32 bit/4 byte representation of -2 is fffffffe.

4. The x value in decimal is 49407, and in hex is c0ff.

5. The expressoin ~255 produce -256 in decimal, and ffffff00 in hex.

6. The result is 127. This is because -1 is 1111 1111 in binary. When this number
is & with (128-1), the result is 127. 

7. One more bit-wise operation is needed to test for a power of two.
